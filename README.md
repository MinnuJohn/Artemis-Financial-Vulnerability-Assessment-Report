# Artemis-Financial-Vulnerability-Assessment-Report
### Client Summary and Software Requirements

**Client:** Artemis Financial

**Software Requirements:** Artemis Financial is a consulting company specializing in individualized financial plans including savings, retirement, investments, and insurance. They want to modernize their operations and ensure their custom software employs the latest and most effective security measures. Specifically, they have a RESTful web API that requires protection from external threats.

**Issue to Address:** Artemis Financial seeks to identify and mitigate security vulnerabilities in their web-based software application to safeguard against external threats and enhance secure communications.

### Finding Software Security Vulnerabilities

**What was done well:** The process involved a thorough manual review and static testing of the code base to identify security vulnerabilities. This included using tools like the Maven dependency-check plug-in to scan for known vulnerabilities.

**Importance of Secure Coding:** Secure coding is essential to prevent unauthorized access, data breaches, and other security incidents that can damage a company's reputation and financial standing. Secure software ensures the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of data, which is crucial for maintaining customer trust and regulatory compliance.

**Value of Software Security:** Software security adds significant value by protecting sensitive information, ensuring regulatory compliance, preventing financial loss, and maintaining the company's reputation. It also reduces the risk of cyber-attacks and enhances overall system reliability and performance.

### Challenging and Helpful Parts of Vulnerability Assessment

**Challenging Part:** One of the challenging aspects was accurately identifying and prioritizing vulnerabilities, especially those that are less obvious or have complex interdependencies within the code.

**Helpful Part:** Utilizing static testing tools like the Maven dependency-check plug-in was particularly helpful in systematically identifying known vulnerabilities and providing detailed reports on potential security issues.

### Increasing Layers of Security

**Increasing Layers of Security:** Implementing multiple layers of security involved:

- **Input Validation:** Ensuring all user inputs are validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks.
- **Authentication and Authorization:** Strengthening authentication mechanisms and ensuring proper authorization controls are in place.
- **Dependency Management:** Regularly updating and managing third-party libraries to avoid vulnerabilities from outdated dependencies.
- **Secure Configuration:** Applying secure configuration settings for servers, databases, and other infrastructure components.

**Future Assessment Tools:** In future assessments, tools like OWASP ZAP, Snyk, and other automated security scanners can be used to identify vulnerabilities and decide on appropriate mitigation techniques.

### Ensuring Functional and Secure Code

**Ensuring Functionality and Security:** Post-refactoring, the functionality and security of the code were verified through a combination of automated tests, manual code reviews, and static analysis. Regression testing ensured that changes did not introduce new vulnerabilities.

**Checking for New Vulnerabilities:** After refactoring, running the code through static analysis tools and performing additional manual reviews were crucial steps to ensure no new vulnerabilities were introduced.

### Useful Resources, Tools, and Practices

**Resources and Tools:**
- **Static Analysis Tools:** Tools like SonarQube and dependency-check for identifying vulnerabilities.
- **Manual Review Techniques:** In-depth code reviews and pair programming for thorough inspection.
- **Secure Coding Guidelines:** Following OWASP Secure Coding Practices and other industry standards.

**Helpful Practices:**
- **Regular Code Reviews:** Continuous code review processes to identify and fix vulnerabilities early.
- **Dependency Management:** Keeping third-party libraries up-to-date to avoid known vulnerabilities.
- **Automated Testing:** Using automated tests to ensure both functionality and security.

### Examples for Future Employers

**Work Examples:** For future employers, showcasing detailed vulnerability assessment reports, examples of refactored secure code, and documentation of the mitigation plans would demonstrate skills in identifying, addressing, and preventing security vulnerabilities.
